        <p class="message">
            Every morning, I find myself caught in a thought I couldn’t escape what do you do when your heart longs for something it can never truly have? Imagine building a connection with someone over time, so deep and natural that it feels like it was always meant to be. Then one day you realize your feelings have grown into something more something that changes how you see the world
        </p>
        <p class="message">
            You gather the courage to share what you’ve been holding onto only to hear that they care for you deeply but not in the way you had hoped To them you’re a safe place someone irreplaceable but not the one they’d hold closest.
        </p>
        <p class="message">
            And yet something keeps you from walking away You’ve grown too fond of them too tied to the way they make your world feel a little less heavy You try to tame the love in your heart to shrink it to fit the space they’ve given you but it’s like trying to bottle up the ocean in your hands In the morning when the world feels fresh and full of possibilities it’s their face you see And at night when everything is silent and the thoughts are loudest it’s their presence that lingers a quiet ache you can’t shake.
